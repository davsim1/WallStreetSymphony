Usage:
- Clone this repository
- Add all files to your MatLab path
- Run main.m through MatLab and follow the input instructions

Output:
A graph of your inputted stock price versus time with an orange line for the price you purchased the stock at. Music representing gains and losses. 

What it does
Our MatLab project takes input, plots your stock's price versus time, and plays music to represent the graph's relation to your stock. If the stock price is above your purchased price, chords in C major (with octave) play to represent gains. If the stock price is below your purchased price, chords in E minor 7 play to represent losses. Amplitude (loudness) changes to show you how far away from your purchased price the data is. Usage: Run our MatLab file main.m to input a stock symbol (ex: GOOG), the price you purchased your stock at, the date you purchased your stock at, the start date for the graph, and the end date for the graph.

How we built it
Our team of four, Evan, Juliet, Josephine, and David, collaborated with Git through Atlassian Sourcetree and GitHub to implement our project with a series of MatLab functions. We used Yahoo Finance through the Matlab fetch command to retrieve the stock data. Juliet created chords and notes in MusicMaker.

Challenges we ran into
Utilizing various tools in tandem which may create merge conflicts or other confusion.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Working together as a team on platforms we were unfamiliar with to create a functioning program.

What we learned
We learned how to manipulate complicated stock data in MatLab as well as import and use music files programmatically. We learned how to navigate Git as a team of four to share code.

What's next for WallStreetSymphony
Whatâ€™s next is incorporating more than one stock in our graph and music. We already pull the data for multiple stocks from Yahoo Finance into a 3-D MatLab array, so next would be to layer the music and graphs.
